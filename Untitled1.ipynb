      "Review 2: The buffet was very nice and had a lot of varieties. The toilets and the conference halls stinks (Noida branch).\n",
      "Review 3: Masala House is a must visit and is one of the popular restaurants in New Delhi. the restaurant is situated near Sunder Nagar.\n",
      "Review 4: This restaurant located in the interiors of majnu ka tila is similar to many other restaurants located in the vicinity, with north eastern crowd as well as serving staff, authentic Tibetan dishes and even the decor resembling the same touch, it looks like a complete deal. Sadly, when you try to go a little step further in your expectations with Indian cuisine and variety of alcoholic drinks, it ends of short. The waiting time of dishes too is longer than usual and I was even charged unnecessary amount due to wrong addition in bill. Considering all this and not just the taste, I would think it as a mediocre hotel\n",

      "Cluster 2 Sample Reviews:\n",
      "Review 1: On our last day in Delhi we decided to be ridiculous and try out the American cuisine... this place boasts its hotdogs but my husband ordered one and couldn't finish it... the \"chili\" was awful he said, and tasted nothing like actual chili. I got my favorite appetizers which were OK: the onion rings were pretty good but the buffalo wings were actually just BBQ wings and I had to ask for tobasco. The \"ranch\" it came with was pretty good though. I ordered a Caesar salad was awful. It was warm iceberg lettuce with a ranch-like sauce with a beneficial slice of toasted buttered bread to distract frm the really weird, chemical taste... I have no idea what it was but it wasn't normal. I know you're not supposed to try and get salad stuff in India but I really thought it might be OK since I've gotten nice salads at my hotel, but I couldn't eat this. The tiramisu latte milkshake was pretty but made with the poorest quality ice cream that was more water than anything... but there was a bit of rum at the bottom I was able to drink up to forget this terrible meal. There was a large array of breakfast/brunch items, so maybe these are better... Don't try and come here if you are feeling homesick or you will just feel sadder.\n",
      "Review 2: Had the kulcha chola n whole wheat wrap. Both were supposedly healthy options. My feeling is that it wasn't exactly incredibly healthy, but they did make it healthier than standard stuff, and relatively good tasting too.\n",
      "Review 3: If you ache for a departure from fancy modern cuisines entering our culinary scenario, and wish to pamper your taste buds with authentic Indian food spread, then look no further than Dilli 32. Dilli 32, the fine-dining restaurant nestled at The Leela Convention hotel, had made its presence felt by having delectable Awadhi and North Indian food. Expanding its horizon, the restaurant now boasts of a menu that has its previous menu intact, alongside offering an array of regional specialities, for both, its vegetarian and non-vegetarian patrons. My dinner at Dilli 32, a couple of days back, commenced with an interesting Makhania Lassi, which was more like a set yoghurt infused with cardamom and rose, and some binge-worthy fried lotus stems tossed in spices. Then we graduated to the appetisers, which were all delicious in their own decided decadence. Of course, a few of them clearly stood out from the rest, leaving a mark on my palate and leaving me with the willingness to have more. Those include- the melt-in-mouth subz galawat prepared from yam, raw banana, bottle gourd and a medley of spices, the masala slathered chicken drumsticks, called kodi vepudu that packed the curry leaves flavour punch, and my favourite: the perfectly cooked barkas chappe or mutton chops, that had an explosion of flavours in my mouth. With the bar raised with the starters, the mains only followed suit by offering an equally good flavour profile, making it difficult to pick favourites. The sea-food-lover in me would vouch for their chingri malai curry that would gel perfectly well with a portion of steamed rice. However, it will be the murg ka salan that I’d bet my money on. Perfectly cooked morsels of chicken in a onion, garlic and peanut-based gravy, the dish turned out to be a stellar combination with the fragrant and aromatic Dilli ki Biryani. Though generally overlooked, their yellow dal or dal mooradabadi is not an offering that you’d want to waive off. Cooked in a copper utensil and topped with a variety of condiments like green chillies, asafetida, ginger, dry mango powder, cumin powder et al, this, needless to say, is a must-have. A sweet conclusion was sought to mark the success of the dinner and was met by three delicious sweet offerings, that included: rabri falooda, shahi tukra and mirch ka halwa. I do have a big sweet tooth but when it comes to Indian desserts, I prefer the ones that aren’t as sweet and hence, rabri falooda somehow did the trick for me!\n",
      "Review 4: Yesterday I went to Sixth Emperica for brunch, we ordered Honey chilli potato, paneer tikka, Margherita pizza and hakka noodles All the dishes were delicious in taste and were worth the money. And also we ordered two cocktails: L.I.I.T and Kentucky mint julep. Both were amazing and is highly recommended. The service was up to the mark. The staff was very courteous and they also followed all the safety measures.  The ambience of this place is so wonderful and exotic. Must visit this place!\n",
      "Review 5: GK1 is one of the shopping spots in the city and we all know how hungry that exercise makes us! With classy interiors and delicious food, Spago deserves to be considered for your next date or luncheon. Serving authentic Italian food, the chefs attempt to bring Rome and Italy to the Delhite’s plate and palate. The place has been functional since the last 14 years and enjoys a loyal clientele who regularly visit the place for meetings or after work meals. I was recently invited for a review and the place left an indelible imprint on my taste buds! The moment you enter the place, the décor reminds you of Jane Austen books and the sophisticated luncheons hosted in the Victorian Era. Every table is presented with a complimentary herb bread platter. The aroma of herbs and garlic sets the mood. For drinks, Masala Margarita and Sex on the Beach is a good choice. The Masala Margarita had a guava base and the salt and chilli mixture on the rim of the glass mixed with the cocktail leaves behind a spicy trail; right from the tip of your tongue to its end. It is truly an invigorating experience.  Our meal began with Caesar Salad which had all the ingredients and the dressing in perfect proportions. Many restaurants go low on the dressing, thus depriving the Salad of its traditional flavor. Here, the crunchy lettuce tossed with chicken shreds and cherry tomatoes in a lovely dressing was a befitting start to our meal. Tagliatelle Morel was perfect in flavor but completely wrong in its choice of Pasta. Tagliatelle is a ribbon shaped pasta frilled at the edges. The combination of frilled pasta and Morel mushrooms, which are a rarity, intrigued me. But what came to the table was a Fettuccine Pasta cooked with morel mushrooms. It tasted wonderful, but it wasn’t Tagliatelle. For Main Course we settled on a Quattro Stagioni Pizza and and Valdostana. The Pizza was very disappointing. It lacked cheese and though it consisted of 4 varieties of toppings, none of them could reach the bar set high by their starters. The crust, however, deserves to be applauded. It was crispy and prepared very well. Valdostana was a dish of Chicken breast stuffed with ham and cooked in a Mascarpone cheese based sauce. It came with a side of grilled vegetables and rosemary potatoes. This was definitely the star of our meal. The sauce had permeated to every inch of the chicken and the ham slices inside the chicken were a welcome addition. The aroma, taste and presentation made my heart jump with joy. It was an absolute tornado of flavours. The rosemary potatoes complimented the dish very well.  For desserts, we were torn between Tiramisu and Torta Royale, their specialty. It was too hard a decision to make so we ordered both. The Torta Royale had a Masterchef vibe to it and was too pretty to be consumed! The binary of hot and cold creates a nice effect. The white chocolate, the mascarpone, everything comes together to give your taste buds a high. When it comes to Tiramisu, one can rarely go wrong. One of the oldest Italian desserts, Spago creates magic yet again with their Tiramisu. It isn’t the best, but definitely better than many other places.  Spago scores high on décor and maintains the authenticity of Italian cuisine. I found it a bit too pricey for the quantities they serve but, I guess, an occasional splurge is ok. For a genuine Italian fare, do give Spago a try.\n",

      "Review 3: I visted this Restaurant a branch of Hotel Saravana Bhavan Chain of Restaurants on a Saturday to have South Indian Meal. Being a week end, there was crowd waiting for their seats and I could get one quickly as I was alone. This place is very neat and clean and they serve south Indian, North Indian Cuisines also limited Chinese items. I ordered a South Indian Thali or Meal Plate along with Poori and Rice option. Poori is made of Wheat Flour and fried in oil. My meal thali had 1 cup of rice, 3 pooris, dal, potato fry, kootu, sweet, sambar ,Rasam, curd etc. The meal was quite fresh, hot and tasty, I enjoyed the meal. The bearers were courteous and service was fast. I will confidently suggest to any one visiting Delhi who is looking for a good and neat South Indian Restaurant.\n",

      "Review 2: We went for gulati but it was veg only due to navarathri. So we went to this place for me food. The starters are good. The Malawi kofta was not up to the mark. I had better Malawi kofta in Chennai.Biriyani also OK only.\n",
      "Review 3: One of the best place in Delhi if you are looking for steaming hot authentic Chicken curry, Brain curry, Gurde Kapoore, Saag Meet etc. This place has Dhaba kind of sitting but is sufficiently hygienic. Best thing is you can ask for extra helpings of curry at no extra charge. A must visit place for die hard Non Veg fans. All preparation is in Desi Ghee and Matter Paneer and Palak Paneer are equally good. I am a 2nd generation regular visitor to this place and can say that the taste and quality is more or less consistent during all these years.\n",

Their service just touched my heart. Quite professional, friendly & efficient. 5/5 for Service, Food & Ambience. Would visit very soon. Thankyou NYC - Radisson Blu Plaza. :)\n",

      "Review 1: The restaurant is located on a high rise building and the elevator service is too slow to take you up to the restaurant. The revolving restaurant has a well maintained ambience however to our surprise they did not allow our infant stroller to be kept near our table which caused us loads of trouble. They have an elaborate range of servings based on their menu and I am totally satisfied with the food quality they served. The outside view of the city is stunning and I would recommend anyone who wants to have a good bite of North Indian delicacies to visit this place. We had been there for lunch so grabbing a table was easy but I have no clue if there is waiting during the evenings. The Kulfi was by far the best thing we ate at that place. Service was quick and we were satisfied. However disappointment was there because the restaurant has no thoughts of Infants or Children visiting this place. I would have given them a 4 star if Children were given a priority at this restaurant.\n",
      "Review 2: Worst customer service. Worst restaurant in sector 29. Manager does not have knowledge of any service.very impolite manager and staff don't know how to serve customers. Congested place. Irony is that manager doesn't know how to manage. So crowded that you would not get any place after 8 on weekends and quality of food and drinks is also very bad. Avoid this place for saving your money and time.\n",
      "Review 3: Living in the neighbourhood and being a member of the hotel's gym/spa, it is ideal to eat at eggspectation. There are healthy options on the menu and the dishes are tasty and satisfying. The food is fantastic and the chefs are obviously talented but unfortunately it is really let down by poor customer service. The waiters are miserable and this creates an unfriendly and stale ambiance. Service is slow and I spend a lot of time trying to get their attention to place an order....even when the restaurant is empty! I have decided to stop going to the restaurant now, as upon my last visit the waiter walked off with my debit card in the payment machine while serving others and disappearing from the restaurant area. When confronted, I received a dismissive response. For a 4 star hotel, you would expect high quality food accompanied by excellent service. Not the case here. \n",
      "Review 4: Naivedyam is one of the most popular south Indian restaurants in Delhi. The quality and taste of the food is excellent. The decor of the restaurant matches the cuisine and you are transported to the heart of south India for a short time. Our experience with the service was very bad. The food ordered came in a reasonable time but after that we were totaly ignored. No one came to ask if we needed to order anything more - one had to make efforts to catch the eye of a steward/assistant. After we had finished no one came to clear the table and after waiting for over 15 minutes I had to personally go and ask the steward to have the table cleared. When finally the table was cleared many small used utensils were left. The ultimate put-down was when we ordered coffee after the meal. It took inordinately long and one had to go again an remind the steward that we had ordered coffee. The coffee came and the waiter instead of serving each one individually left the coffee at one end of the table (we were a group of seven) leaving us to pass the coffee amongst us. Such poor service is never rendered in the busy Udupi restaurants which charge a fraction of what Naivedyam charges.\n",
      "Review 5: Useless Place. We went to so the so called A State of Music last nite for the Gippy Grewal live show. Instead of a A State of Music we were in A State of Shock. The timing given was 9PM. We reached around 10PM and the place was empty. Certain areas were cordoned off for so called VIPs. The shock starts with the bar having only TUBORG beer. A 5 star hotel having just one choice of beer was undigestable. We were a couple and took a seat in the general area and ordered drinks. After about 30 mins one bouncer comes and asks us to vacate the seats as they were also reserved for VIPs. One couldnt argue with them so we promptly vacated the seats. Crowd had started pouring in and the dance floor was full of people. The DJ was pathetic and didnt know M of Music or Mixing Music. Most of the people had come for the live performance of Gippy Grewal and the star himself entered the arena at 12.45 AM. Overall a very bad experience and the first and the last time we have gone for ASOM.\n",

      "Review 1: Have Been to this place from last 15 years or so ..I have to say that its the MOst Authentic Arabic Staple food in town . The Doners are the best along with Grilled Chicken . The Vegetarian spread has Hummus and Falafel which is good .  As this place is a bit far from where we stay now , we tried a lot of places offering the same but I have to say that there no Match to this ..  . The service is good and I call them 15 minutes in advance to be delivered to my car and I have never been disappointed as parking does become a hassle sometime .\n",
      "Review 2: I was a part of function organized by my Kashmiri friend in this restaurant. Samavar as i have understood is the vessel used to make the kashmiri tea \"Kahwa\". I did enjoy that tea which was perfectly made , more so because my Aunty was overlooking the arrangements. I relished all the items presented to us especially kashmiri dum aloo. Had never eaten such nice dum aloo. Even the plain daal they served was awsum. The interior has many artifacts on display which can be bought too. like the durrie were decorating the walls of restaurant with the price written on it.  Since I was with a big party, we didnt feel any delay in food serving and all, but a general perception was the restaurant is understaffed. Campus has parking space too and the restaurant is located at the junction so taking long turns is not required. From one traffic signal apart, you can easily turn your vehicle if on the wrong side of road.\n",
      "Review 3: Hauzkhas village , being a place where there is a watering hole’s galore , to find a nice place to eat is a challenge, especially when you have a casual dining in your mind and not an indian cuisine dinner or some other fold your sleeves dig into the food , kind of place. IMG_4411IMG_4398 So finding a place with a little happening and soothing environment as well as some serious food (not just pizza, pastas , sheesh touk, burgers kind of cafes) is a quest we had and still have in our minds. So we went to amour to understand how different it is from the usual watering holes of the Village , as well as what gastronomical offerings do they have. Prior to visiting amour , we were made aware that chef Jiten is taking care of the kitchen operations at amour since past few months and that modifications, improvisations and some new creations have been done to the menu. We had one inhibition or something we really wanted to understand was, that how popular is the particular cuisine amongst the regular patrons of the village simultaneously, to understand how different amour is from the regular bars , lounges or cafes. So with this thought in our heads, we pressed the floor button in the elevator that took us right to the entrance of amour. IMG_4304IMG_4288 A beautiful décor welcomed us and we could see a neatly done and aesthetically placed dining area which opens to a view of the forest cover on one side and leads to an open and multi-level terrace/patio on the other side. The place is huge with ample seating and different decor suiting to guest’s mood and preferences. We sat at a nice cabana , which was comfortable to accommodate a group of 4-5 people. We looked into the menu to understand the restaurant serving as they say is a modernized or rather improvised Mediterranean cuisine. We ordered for few drinks and starters. So our first course was a vegetarian as well as a non vegetarian mezze platter. Served in a beautiful platter with extremely intriguing LED Lights, is definitely fancy stuff, while it was being served on other tables it got our attention and I am certain while we were served the same , it looked attractive too. Super style !! DSC_0347DSC_0351 DSC_0352 A chaud froid comprising traditional dips like hummus, baba ghanous and tzasiki served with lamb short ribs on tempered garlic chips, chicken in lebanese spices on skewers and a couple grilled prawns with meditteranean flavours . The lamb was stunning and was enjoyed well with the garlic chips it was served on, chicken was succulent and flavorful as well as the prawn. Hummus however was a bit bland and similarly Baba ghanous was pretty average. The veg version had spinach spinakopita, cheese stuffed baby aubergines and dolmas with wine leaves. while the non veg platter looked distinct and tasted different, it was quite the opposite with the veg platter. Though the flavors were nice, it was pretty redundant. DSC_0344DSC_0345 Next In line was ginger chilli grilled prawns with feta and mango salsa. 6 pcs. Of medium sized prawns arranged neatly over raw and ripe mango salsa with feta.The combination was precisely kept and flavors complimented each other nicely. It was a brilliant preparation and somehow I have fallen in love with mango and prawns combination!! DSC_0340 Mist sprinklers with air blowers made sure the seating was comfortable despite it being a humid July evening. Time was for my favorite course – Soups . DSC_0360DSC_0362 Our eyes lit up to see some quite innovative soups featured in the list that made us order a couple portions. Mango gazpacho with fennel and basil seeds and curried pumpkin and coconut soup with broccoli souffle. DSC_0366DSC_0367 Woahh!! we went complete bonkers after the course , the mango gazpacho was cold and flavors of anise and beautifully spiked up made our evening, On the other hand broccoli mousse was soft and soup tasted brilliant with curried flavors gentled with coconut. Cocktails meanwhile, kept us engaged while we indulged ourselves in the surroundings enjoying the music that was soft and non-intrusive. The cocktails some great and some average while some not beyond the first gulp, have a scope of improvement in order to hit the jackpot along with food and ambience. DSC_0373w2 Next were salads, the first was watermelon salad with organic cucumber and feta , illustrating thoughtful combination with precise portioning and well executed with bright red neat squares of the fruit arranged over feta mousse encased in thin strips of cucumber. The second was Asian crumb chicken with raspberry and mint vinaigrette- nicely tossed up and the leaves had punch, the chicken was quite ordinary though. Time was to get to the mains – and we wanted to compare the beef out here with the ones we have been having at other equally reputed or better restaurants. We had a beef steak, a grilled Pomfret from their grill section and a pizza. DSC_0383 The beef came with just perfect doneness , done in an unconventional way.It was sliced cooked fillet over succotash, pommery butter and aubergine pate.The thing to admire was the way the dish was presented .it was a wooden round-oval block on it was succotash and sliced beef, potato pave, butter sauce around and smeared on one side was the aubergine pate that camouflaged so well that the server had to point it out. Truly amazing.and it did score above any we have eaten so far. DSC_0382 Grilled pomfret with chimichuri salsa was rustically presented with just done whole pomfret, crunchy vegetables on side and there goes the chimichuri salsa over the top. Flavorsome and enjoyable. It gives an insight on the quality level that kitchen maintains as churning simple dishes as this is not simple with many great restaurants. DSC_0392DSC_0390 Pizza was a fluffed one and bang on -not super crusty just there it’s supposed to be. We also had a yellow curry risotto , risotto had a nice flavor and served with parmesan sheet , had a nice savory taste , however lack of vegetables or meat made it too uniform for us to enjoy it till the last bite. DSC_0393DSC_0394 The desserts red velvet and chef recommended chocolate …..The chocolate dessert was delicious , though not much to carry as reminiscent, taste of the latter was average. The evening turned out to be a gourmet affair with many excellent and sumptous dishes revolving around haute cooking. DSC_1048 Chef Jiten Now coming to our main conclusion was something which got us thinking. Thought 1 : Chef Jiten , has done a tremendous job at uplifting the menu and dishes that is at par with top restaurants of the city however, more than that , the thought process of cooking and sticking to promote an innovative bent to cook nouvelle dishes in a market which perceives every rooftop terrace restaurant to be a partying place or a watering hole, deserves much attention. On the other hand it lacks support to showcase the culinary thought to the right market as well as putting the right picture / image of the restaurant and the cuisine it specializes in. Thought 2 : How competent is the restaurant of being able to draw a substantial clientele and continuously serve excellently to be able to become first choice place to eat at , for the fine dining clientele of Delhi.? Thought 3 : How many restaurants suffer from such misplacements or misperceptions owing to their location, their clientele , incorrect or lack of marketing / PR and most importantly lack of service support ? Thought 4 : What are the ways ahead for Amour ? Our Conclusions / recommendations are as follows : Thought 1 : I was impressed and find it an encouraging sign to meet and understand Chef Jiten , who is trying to pursue an innovative style of cooking , and most importantly , doing it seriously , giving the process its due respect. In a short, yet meaningful interaction with Chef, It was pleasing to learn his learning attitude and being open to suggestions as well as good at figuring out the anomalies by himself. Now , How to solve it , I leave it to their expertise !! So with this, I remain hopeful to consider Hauzkhas Village as another place to go for some quality dining. Thought 2 : Now though food is a major differ\n",

      "Review 5: I would like to be critical of this restraurant, although I can't really think of any negatives. From the first visit I was treated like a regular and the staff made me feel welcome, but never making me uncomfortable by being overly familiar. The layout of the restraurant is modern, well put together (especially the countless mirrors for people watching) and works to give a relaxed atmosphere for a very mixed crowd of expats, tourists and locals. The food on both occassions I have eaten here has been excellent. A special mention for the 'Sweet crispy spinach leaves', a house special, which were recommended. I wasn't sure about these, but they did not disappoint, and am sad i won't be able to get them when i return to my native country. The mains I've had here were also perfectly spiced and full of flavour. The meat was served on the bone, however this was not an issue as it took little effort to remove it as its so tender. The Kulfi ice cream and the Gulab julam were also very enjoyable ends to two very good meals, not being overly sweet but well executed. I left here both nights feeling very satisfied as a good meal with proper service always leaves you. I'd recommend Veda to any one.\n",

      "Review 4: Social has been one of my favorite cafes in delhi. It has an amazing interiors combined with mindblowing views of the lake and happening HKV crowd #ambiance & interiors : 6/5 This place is simply superb in terms of how you can relax. There are numerous seating levels and styles. From large windows to terraces to private sofas. Except the low lighting, you will enjoy coming each time and experiencing a different part of Social. At each seating type, you will meet a unique crowd and you can get social with them #service : 4.5 Excellent service with your orders coming in a short duration and numerous servers throughout the entire cafe #price : 4 expensive but then again by location and crowd and simply for the excellent atmosphere its alright #food: 3.5 #longislandtea: don't order. It comes in a fancy glass but it tasted more like coke and less alcholic #masalapeanuts : average. Come served in a tiffin #chickentikka : fresh meat. Nicely made. Most of the starters were well made though nothing exceptional about the cooking. Even the cocktails felt very diluted Best for hanging out with your significant other and enjoying each others company while gazing into the horizon !!\n",
      "Review 5: I'm a bit late in reviewing but would still like to acknowledge the lovely time we had here in sept'13. It was a get together with friends and we randomly walked in here and just loved the ambience!! Perfect setting for a get together or to chill with friends. Nice quality of food and drinks and good service. 4 stars because they brought me a rum instead of vodka, must have misunderstood due to music but not acceptable. Anyways we still had a great time so cheers! Would like to go back soon.\n",
